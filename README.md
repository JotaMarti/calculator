# Calculator by JotaMarti
Calculator made with Visual Studio 2015 (VB 14.0)

This is a project in course for the class of "DiseÃ±o de interfaces", I will be updating this calculator untils it reaches its final form. Here are the different stages:

- **Stage 1**: Perform a calculator with basic operations. In the first delivery, functionality will be limited to numeric buttons, not operations.
- **Stage 2**: In the second part, you are required to perform the 4 basic operations as well as the deletion. Remember that the calculator must allow concatenated operations, for example, 2+5-6.
- **Stage 3**: We continue to add functionality: Complete Erase: Last Digit. Screen (CE) and Total (C). Work with decimals. Work with the sign (negative numbers). Implement the operations of % (percent) and 1/x (reverse).
- **Stage 4**: Features to add to our calculator: Menu that allows you to switch from standard mode to scientific mode (e.g. View --> Standard | Scientific). In scientific mode, we'll implement the following functions: x^2, x^3, x^y, n!.
- **Stage 5**: Features to add to our calculator: Menu that allows to display a help window. Implement the help window. Redesign your calculator (if you think it's necessary) and apply what you learned during its development to improve written code.

Right now I have finished Stage 5 and the calculator looks like this:
